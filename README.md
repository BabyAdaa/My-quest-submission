1. Explain what Blockchain is in your own words

A blockchain is a database that stores encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data
Digital assets are distributed instead of copied or transferred, creating an immutable record of an asset
The asset is decentralized, allowing full real-time access and transparency to the public
A transparent ledger of changes preserves integrity of the document, which creates trust in the asset.
Blockchain’s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for almost every single sector.

2. Explain what a smart contract is

A smart contract is a self-executing digital agreement that enables two or more parties to exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the need for a third party.
To lay it out in the most simplest way, you can compare smart contracts to a vending machine for complex transactions.
Ordinarily, if you have a complex transaction involving significant money, you would need to go to a lawyer or a notary, have them set up an escrow account, pay them, and wait while they do the work and ensure the contract terms are satisfied. Only once your lawyer has done the work to ensure everything is executed correctly will you get the document/goods/money, etc.
With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, deed, contract, goods, driver’s licence, or whatever the contract is for, simply drops into your account.

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transcript

Transaction can lead to cost of money depending The Blockchain you are interacting with.
Different transaction fee occur on Ethereum, Solana, cardano,binance Smart chain and Fantom Blockchain.
They are always different when it comes to transaction fee.

Script is used to retrieve data on the Blockchain, it can't be changed and it doesn't cost money too.
